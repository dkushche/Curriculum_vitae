# Curriculum Vitae

The main idea of this project is to organize my experience and write it as code. It should help with inventory, self-development planning, and keeping stuff more under control.

It's reasonable to keep structure as:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    Field-->Field_Description;
    Field-->Level_of_Profiency;
    Field-->Field_Tools;
    Field-->Projects;

    Field_Tools-->Skills;

    Projects-->Name_and_description;
    Projects-->Type;
    Projects-->Responsibilities;
    Projects-->Tools;
```

It generates up-to-date CVs for different positions and places them in release.
