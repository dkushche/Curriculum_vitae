\section{Backend Development}

\subsection{Description}

I don't have commercial experience related to backend development, but still,
it's really important to understand what is going on on the other side, so I
learn how to deal with it during working on my pet projects.
Moreover, it's much easier to configure software if you even briefly understand how it works.
