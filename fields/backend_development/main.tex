\section{Backend Development}

\subsection{Description}

I don't have commercial experience as a backend developer,
but still dealing with backends it's an important part of my job.
From time to time there is a need to test or write small APIs for personal,
charity, or commercial projects. Moreover, it's much easier to configure software
if you even briefly understand how it works, that is why I like to invest my time in this field.
