\section{Backend Development}

\subsection{Description}

I have 3 years of commercial experience as a backend engineer.
I worked on a smart heating system where the first priority was to improve the existing architecture,
as the project was largely “vibe-coded.” I introduced database normalization, separated entities,
created service layers for improved code reuse and testing, and split the codebase into clear layers
to enforce separation of responsibilities. The project was built using FastAPI.

Another project I worked on was a truck telemetry data processing platform. It ingested metrics and
events from trucks via Kinesis and RabbitMQ, then processed the data according to FMCSA regulations.
My responsibility was to design, optimize, and maintain reliable data processing pipelines.
