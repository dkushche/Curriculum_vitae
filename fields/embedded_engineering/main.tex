\section{Embedded Engineering}

\subsection{Description}

For over 4 years of commercial experience in Embedded Engineering,
I gained many skills from the different levels of product development. I can
highlight 3 families of skills which are helpfull for me.

Software development includes not only user space applications development,
but also firmware and kernel space development.

\subsection{Projects}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Commercial 4\break
    Project description:\break
    The client is an IoT connection provider offering internet connectivity for any
    smart product, automatically and securely, right out of the box.\break
    Responsibilities:\break
    Building test system infrastructure (HTTP(s) servers, Netlink, procfs, sysfs, DNS
    se server mocks), improvement of OTA updates for Linux and FreeRTOS devices.
    Interaction with wifi driver using vendor API. Tasks management, colleagues
    support, participation in the discussions\break
    Tools \& Technologies:\break
    Python, Bash, C, Linux, FreeRTOS, Docker, Make, Jenkins, Pytest, Netlink, dpkg,
    initd, systemd, mcuboot
    \item Commercial 3\break
    Project description:\break
    The service coordinates workers and managers and records all data in the
    cloud for further analytics and workflow improvements in smart warehouses,
    manufacturing facilities, field services, and in a variety of other rugged work
    environments\break
    Responsibilities:\break
    Updating wpa\_supplicant for an industrial wearable device. Fixing WiFi
    connection delay issue
    Tools \& Technologies:\break
    Android, ADB, C, wpa\_supplicant, netlink, Make, repo, git
    \item Commercial 2\break
    Project description:\break
    The client had a custom router for which he needed firmware. The main task
    was to create a universal firmware with a user-friendly UI, which makes it
    possible possible to configure networks like on advanced routers, as well as to be a
    station for IoT devices\break
    Responsibilities:\break
    Improving custom WiFi router firmware. Adding user-friendly UI for network
    policies manipulation: isolation (adding VLANs for L2, firewall settings for L3),
    blocking Internet resources(black/white listing), captive portal setup,
    Wifi management\break
    Tools \& Technologies:\break
    OpenWRT, Lua, LuCI ip, iptables, brctl, iw, wpa\_supplicant, dnsmasq, CoovaChilli,
    Squid transparent proxy, git, das u-boot
    \item Commercial 1\break
    Project description:\break
    The client had a project that used unsafe functions from libc, such as strcpy. It
    created security risks and potential overflows. The main objective was to find
    a and fix all unsafe calls\break
    Responsibilities:\break
    Securing libc functions calls in existed software\break
    Tools \& Technologies:\break
    C, Linux, Redmine, GitLab
